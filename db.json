The average life expectancy in IPF patients is 2-3 years. The only drug that has been registered in a number of countries for the treatment of IPF is pirfenidone. It was launched in Japan in 2008 under the brand name Pirespa® and was approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate IPF in Europe and Canada in 2011 (under the brand name Esbriet®).",

Other pharmacologic options include corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and N-acetyl cysteine, albeit none of these has been proven efficacious in clinical trials compared with placebo, and none is indicated for the treatment of IPF. Thus, despite the availability of pirfenidone and the possibility of lung transplantation, the medical need for efficacious and safe treatment of IPF remains high. Nintedanib has been developed for the treatment of IPF and for several cancer types in two separate clinical development programmes. In IPF the clinical proof of concept for nintedanib was established in the 52-week phase II trial 1199.30P11-11216).",
